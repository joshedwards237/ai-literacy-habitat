# inv-firewall.sh — the deterministic teeth of the dynamic-workflows
# governance invariants (INV-1 and INV-2). One matcher, invoked two ways:
# a PR-time GitHub gate (.github/workflows/dynamic-workflows-firewall.yml)
# and a Layer-0 deterministic test with red/green fixtures. Keeping the logic
# in a single script means both callers enforce exactly the same rule.
#
# Why this exists. A dynamic workflow is ephemeral and generated; the durable
# artefacts (HARNESS.md, AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, MODEL_ROUTING.md) are
# human-curated. INV-1 forbids a workflow from writing them directly. INV-2
# quarantines untrusted-content readers from high-privilege tools. Both are
# stated for agents in the skill's governance.md; this script is what makes
# them fail CI rather than merely advise.
#
# Design decisions (spec §7, human-approved at the S2 GATE; hardened after the
# S2 adversarial review closed three bypasses):
#   - INV-1 = layered "Option C". Strip comments first, then fail if any durable
#     STEM (HARNESS, AGENTS, CLAUDE, MODEL_ROUTING) survives into executable
#     code as a whole word — independent of the `.md` suffix. Matching the stem
#     rather than the full filename defeats name-splitting ("AGENTS" + ".md",
#     `${dir}/AGENTS.md`, ["AGENTS",".md"].join("")), and `grep -w` keeps
#     SCREAMING_SNAKE variables (MODEL_ROUTING_TABLE) safe. A literate preamble
#     that merely *names* a durable artefact passes (it is stripped first). The
#     consequence templates must respect: durable artefacts are reached only
#     through harness-provided indirection, never spelled in code.
#   - INV-2 = declared markers "Option I1". A template annotates an
#     untrusted-content reader with `// @untrusted-reader: true` and declares
#     its `// @tools: [...]`; the lint fails if that set names a high-privilege
#     tool (write, edit, bash, commit, push, fetch, webfetch). The check is
#     case-insensitive (markers and values), accumulates a multi-line `@tools`
#     list, fails closed on an unterminated list, and is independent of the
#     order of the three markers within an agent block. Passes vacuously when no
#     untrusted reader is declared.
#
# Known limit (by design). This is a deterministic backstop to a human PR
# review, not a sandbox against a hostile author. A durable filename split
# mid-stem ("AGEN" + "TS.md"), constructed from char codes, or written in a
# casing that never forms the uppercase stem token defeats static stem matching
# — closing that needs taint analysis well beyond a grep gate. The real control
# is the discipline the templates model (durable artefacts reached only through
# harness indirection); the firewall catches the natural mistakes, and a human
# reviewer reads the same PR.
#
# Portability: POSIX awk + grep -E only (no gawk/GNU extensions, no `grep -P`,
# no BSD-only date) so the Layer-0 test runs identically on macOS and Linux.
#
# Usage:
#   inv-firewall.sh --check=inv1 <file...>
#   inv-firewall.sh --check=inv2 <file...>
# Exit 0 = clean; non-zero = at least one violation (message on stdout).
